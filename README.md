## Overview

### The challenge

A demo gif was given along with some basic HTML, the task was to create the webpage to the best of our abilities whilst following the acceptance criteria.
This involved implementing functions such as media queries and using grids and flex-box to create the webpage.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I now can properly understand how useful grid and flex-box are for making webpage design much easier, i also enjoyed learning about how 
background images can be used and edited.

### Continued development

I have had difficulty getting my nav links to work for my page so i will be continuing to try and figure out how to get them to work
I think getting used to how i should use grids and flex-box will be very beneficial in the future. I will possibly use this site as my actual portfolio in the future
and replace the content as needed.
